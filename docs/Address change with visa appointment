Subject: Notification of Address Change and Visa Appointment Date

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you of two important updates regarding my immigration status. Firstly, I would like to inform you of a recent change in my residential address. As a law-abiding resident and a registered immigrant, it is my responsibility to keep the Immigration Office updated regarding any changes in my personal information, including my place of residence.

I would like to inform you that I have recently moved to a new address. The details of my previous and new addresses are as follows:

Previous Address:
[Your Previous Address]
[City, State, ZIP Code]

New Address:
[Your New Address]
[City, State, ZIP Code]

The reason for this change is [provide a brief reason if necessary, such as relocation for work or personal reasons]. I kindly request that you update your records accordingly to ensure that all official communications and documents are sent to my new address.

Secondly, I would like to schedule a visa appointment to discuss the renewal/extension of my visa. I understand the importance of keeping my immigration status up to date, and I believe it is time for a visa renewal/extension to ensure continued compliance with the regulations.

I kindly request an appointment for a visa renewal/extension interview at your earliest convenience. I am available on the following dates and times for the appointment:

Preferred Date: [Date]
Preferred Time: [Time]

If the requested date and time are not available, please suggest an alternative appointment that suits your schedule. I am flexible and willing to accommodate any suitable time slot.

I have attached supporting documents that validate my new address, including a copy of my lease agreement/utility bill/bank statement with the new address (choose appropriate document as proof). Additionally, I have included copies of relevant documents related to my current visa status, such as my passport, visa, and any other required supporting documents.

Should you require any additional documentation or information, please do not hesitate to contact me using the contact details provided above.

I understand the importance of complying with all immigration regulations, and I assure you that this address change notification and visa renewal/extension request are being submitted within the required timeframe. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by these changes and appreciate your understanding and cooperation in these matters.

Thank you for your attention to these updates. I look forward to receiving confirmation of the update to my address in your records and the confirmation of the visa appointment date. Should there be any further steps or actions required from my end, please do let me know.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
