To monitor AWS S3 buckets using Grafana, you can leverage AWS CloudWatch metrics, which provides metrics for S3, and then integrate CloudWatch with Grafana. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting it up:

1. Enable S3 Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

	•	AWS S3 metrics are available in CloudWatch, but some metrics may require S3 Storage Lens or CloudWatch request metrics to be enabled:
	•	Basic S3 metrics (e.g., NumberOfObjects, BucketSizeBytes) are automatically available and provide basic usage stats.
	•	Request Metrics (e.g., GetRequests, PutRequests, 4xxErrors, 5xxErrors) are available when you enable Request Metrics on each bucket:
	1.	Go to S3 Console > Buckets > [Select Bucket] > Metrics > Request Metrics.
	2.	Enable request metrics for the bucket (may incur additional costs).
	•	S3 Storage Lens (for advanced metrics, including data usage and trends): Go to S3 Console > Storage Lens and create a dashboard with your desired metrics.

2. Add the AWS CloudWatch Data Source in Grafana

	•	Go to Configuration > Data Sources > Add Data Source in Grafana.
	•	Choose CloudWatch and enter your AWS credentials and region information:
	•	Authentication: Use AWS credentials with read access to CloudWatch and S3.
	•	Region: Select the AWS region where your S3 buckets are located.
	•	Save & Test to confirm the connection.

3. Create a Dashboard for S3 Metrics in Grafana

	•	Once the CloudWatch data source is configured, you can start building a dashboard to display your S3 metrics.

Key Metrics to Monitor:

	•	Bucket Size:
	•	Metric Name: BucketSizeBytes
	•	Namespace: AWS/S3
	•	Statistics: Use the Sum statistic for overall bucket size.
	•	Filters: Choose the storage type (e.g., StandardStorage for standard S3 storage).
	•	Number of Objects:
	•	Metric Name: NumberOfObjects
	•	Namespace: AWS/S3
	•	Filters: Filter by storage type (e.g., AllStorageTypes for all types).
	•	Request Metrics (If Enabled):
	•	Get Requests:
	•	Metric Name: GetRequests
	•	Namespace: AWS/S3
	•	Statistics: Sum (to see the total number of GET requests).
	•	Put Requests:
	•	Metric Name: PutRequests
	•	Statistics: Sum.
	•	4xx Errors: Shows client errors like unauthorized access.
	•	Metric Name: 4xxErrors
	•	Statistics: Sum.
	•	5xx Errors: Shows server errors.
	•	Metric Name: 5xxErrors
	•	Statistics: Sum.
	•	S3 Storage Lens (If Enabled):
	•	Metrics for trends, data usage, and more, available if Storage Lens is configured.

4. Build Panels for Each Metric

	•	In Grafana, go to + > Dashboard > Add new panel and start adding panels for each metric.
	•	Choose CloudWatch as the data source, then select the metric namespace (AWS/S3), the metric name, and any necessary filters or dimensions (like the bucket name).
	•	Example Panels:
	•	Bucket Size: Time series panel showing the growth of BucketSizeBytes over time.
	•	Request Rates: Time series showing GetRequests, PutRequests, and other request types.
	•	Error Rates: Use a single stat or gauge panel to show current levels of 4xxErrors and 5xxErrors.
	•	Number of Objects: Visualize NumberOfObjects over time to track object count growth.

5. Set Up Alerts (Optional)

	•	You can set up alerts in Grafana to get notifications for important S3 events, like sudden increases in 4xxErrors or large growth in BucketSizeBytes.
	•	Go to the Alert tab in each panel, set up conditions for the alert (e.g., when error rates go above a threshold), and configure notification channels for alert delivery (e.g., email, Slack).

By following these steps, you’ll have a Grafana dashboard that visualizes and monitors your AWS S3 bucket metrics, helping you track usage, errors, and performance trends in real-time.
