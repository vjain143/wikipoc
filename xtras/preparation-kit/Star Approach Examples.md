# Project 
XYZ Contract Manufacturing has undertaken a transformation program, to create an organization that has a set of consistent process and ways of working across the entire organization in all geographic locations. This project manages the business transition of the organization’s base IT technology and operations.
* (S) XYZ has different IT system for all counties across Europe
It was difficult to manage, if any change in product or services, it had to be updated separately for each country for entire organization.
* (T) Task was to streamline the process to make all its system across organization to connect to BCM. So, that if there is a change in product or services, it will be updated at BCM and will be applied all across the organization
* (A) BCM introduced integration to solve this. So now using the integration, all the systems and depts were made to talk to each other and share the data 
For Example: 
* (R) So, after integrating to boos BCM, system was organized and overhead of updating it everywhere get minimized.
* Workflow:
  * Prerequisite: IMI system provides product, price and stock information to WCS
  * User requests goes to WCS (Websphere Commerce System)
  * WCS send check inventory request and place order
    * Request goes to Farms broker
    * Request goes to consignment
    * Request goes to Posten for delivery charge calculation
* What was the architecture
This was layered architecture 
* On the Top we have Frontend WCS (Websphere Commerce System) 
* Middle we have Integration system 
* And on bottom layer of the architecture we have country specific system.
* What approach you followed
We have 4 story here for this project and we did timeboxing of each
1.	We have approached the frontend system to know what are the input and output they need from end system
2	Then we approached end system to know the requested input output and the format of data and data complexity and relationship with in.
3	Is there any flow already fetching same data set from end system? No
So, we have designed this integration flow from scratch
4	Unit Testing and fixing the mismatch and gaps                 

* Why did only this approach<br>
This this approach we can easily able to identify the work and completion based on time box

* How big was your team
  * Agile Team - 9
  * 2 Frontend Developer to implement the change in frontend – 1 at offshore
  * 3 Integration (Myself) - 2 at offshore
  * 2 End System 
  * 2 Tester – 1 at offshore

* What role you were playing
Integration Lead/Developer

# Project
Lending Process Application (LPA) - LPA project is to simplify the lending process of PNC.  It includes remove multi step complex process for lending application. Due to this lending process lifecycle is higher than other competitor banks.  Using integration, we have reduced point to point interaction for each step and used parallel steps wherever possible, though this solution we have simplified lending process lifecycle.                                                                         * (S)

# Project
Treasury & Securities Services - DDA (Demand Deposit Account) provides the method to clients of JPMC to make payment, receive deposit and manage cash flow. This type of account is also commonly known as current account or a cash account.  A DDA is Core product for JPMC client and provide the gateways into many other treasury products. We have limited End of the day capability, and we have complicated model relies on separate systems. So, through integration we have provided Full-Intra-Day capabilities. Our clients can get complete, accurate and timely data, as well as other LOBs and functional group.

Integrated Services Platform (ISP) - This is the first major strategic initiative to use a comprehensive Services Oriented Architecture approach to integration in Dell. The ISP program is to deploy Siebel as the new global CRM tool at Dell
* (S) Dell has few legecy system, have limited functionality like scaling the systm integration with 3rd party system etc. due to this legecy system was isolated and very difficult to implement any functionality. 
* (T) Dell interduced a new system Sibel CRM and integration
