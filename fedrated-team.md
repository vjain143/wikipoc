For managing a platform with Trino as the query engine in a federated query setup, here’s a breakdown of responsibilities and considerations for each area. These tasks can help you divide the workload among teams effectively:

1. Trino Code Changes

	•	Responsible Team: Trino Core/Development Team
	•	Tasks:
	•	Implementing new features and functionality based on evolving platform needs.
	•	Fixing bugs and addressing issues identified in Trino’s open-source code or specific to your platform’s setup.
	•	Reviewing and testing code to ensure compatibility with existing configurations.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Version control for tracking code changes.
	•	Unit and integration testing for stability.

2. Trino Deployment

	•	Responsible Team: DevOps/Platform Engineering
	•	Tasks:
	•	Automating deployment of Trino instances across environments (Dev, QA, Production).
	•	Managing blue-green or canary deployments to minimize disruptions.
	•	Coordinating with the development team to ensure seamless rollout of updates.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	CI/CD pipelines for deployment.
	•	Rollback strategies in case of failures.

3. Trino Catalog Management and Onboarding

	•	Responsible Team: Data Platform Team/Data Engineering
	•	Tasks:
	•	Creating and managing catalogs for various data sources.
	•	Onboarding new data sources and handling configuration.
	•	Updating catalogs with schema changes as needed.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Standardize catalog configurations for consistency.
	•	Document onboarding processes for new catalogs.

4. Trino Access Control (ACL)

	•	Responsible Team: Security/Access Management
	•	Tasks:
	•	Managing user roles and permissions in line with data governance policies.
	•	Implementing row-level, column-level, and schema-based access controls as needed.
	•	Ensuring sensitive data remains protected and accessible only to authorized users.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Regular audits of access controls.
	•	Fine-grained permissions based on data sensitivity.

5. Trino Data Build Pipelines

	•	Responsible Team: Data Engineering/ETL Team
	•	Tasks:
	•	Developing and managing ETL/ELT pipelines that feed data to Trino.
	•	Ensuring data transformations are accurate and efficient.
	•	Handling incremental updates to reduce the load on Trino.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Use scheduling and workflow tools (e.g., Airflow) to orchestrate data builds.
	•	Monitor pipeline performance for any bottlenecks.

6. Trino Maintenance

	•	Responsible Team: Operations/Maintenance Team
	•	Tasks:
	•	Applying patches, security updates, and regular maintenance tasks.
	•	Scaling Trino clusters based on usage patterns and optimizing resources.
	•	Archiving unused catalogs and cleaning up unused tables.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Regular health checks and maintenance windows.
	•	Automated alerts for resource utilization thresholds.

7. Trino Monitoring and Observability

	•	Responsible Team: SRE/Observability Team
	•	Tasks:
	•	Setting up dashboards to monitor Trino performance (e.g., query latency, resource utilization).
	•	Implementing alerting mechanisms for failure, downtime, or unusual activity.
	•	Tracking user queries and identifying patterns for optimization.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) for real-time insights.
	•	Log analysis for root cause investigations and performance tuning.

8. Additional Considerations

	•	Data Governance:
	•	Ensure compliance with data policies, including data lineage, data quality, and retention.
	•	Regular audits and documentation to keep track of data access, modifications, and lifecycle.
	•	User Support and Training:
	•	Providing documentation, training sessions, and FAQs for teams using Trino.
	•	Setting up a support team or help desk for troubleshooting.
	•	Performance Tuning and Query Optimization:
	•	Regular profiling of queries to identify and resolve inefficiencies.
	•	Collaborate with data consumers to promote best practices for query performance.
	•	Capacity Planning:
	•	Forecasting resource needs based on current usage and future growth.
	•	Adjusting hardware or cloud resource allocations as necessary.

Assigning clear ownership of these areas will help ensure accountability and smoother management of the platform. Additionally, regular cross-functional meetings can be helpful for knowledge sharing and addressing dependencies across these domains.
